# C Program Code Folder

Welcome to my C program code folder! This is where I keep all of my C program code.

## Folder Structure

The folder is structured as follows:

- `README.md`: This file you are currently reading.
- `src/`: This directory contains all of the C source code files.
- `bin/`: This directory contains the compiled executable files.

## Usage

To compile and run a program, navigate to the `src/` directory and use the following command:


This will compile the program with warnings enabled, use the C11 standard, and place the executable file in the `bin/` directory. The program will then be executed.

## Contributing
